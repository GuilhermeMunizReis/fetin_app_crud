<h6><i>If you know SQL, you know Drizzle ORM</i></h6>
<hr />
</div>

Drizzle ORM is a TypeScript ORM for SQL databases designed with maximum type safety in mind. It comes with a [drizzle-kit](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror) CLI companion for automatic SQL migrations generation. Drizzle ORM is meant to be a library, not a framework. It stays as an opt-in solution all the time at any levels.

The ORM main philosophy is "If you know SQL, you know Drizzle ORM". We follow the SQL-like syntax whenever possible, are strongly typed ground top and fail at compile time, not in runtime.

Drizzle ORM is being battle-tested on production projects by multiple teams üöÄ Give it a try and let us know if you have any questions or feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yfjTbVXMW4).
